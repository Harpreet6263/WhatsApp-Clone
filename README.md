Inside the parent repository there are two folders ---------------> User-1 and User-2 
clone those inside repositories as
" git clone add https://github.com/Harpreet6263/user-1.git user-1"
" git clone " https://github.com/Harpreet6263/user-2.git"

Now we have two folder as User-1 and User-2.
We have to install node modules by using command npm install. NOTE we need to run this command twice in each user as once in frontend and in backnd as well , its demonstrataed below----
------------------------------------------
For user-1
cd user-1
cd backend 
npm install
cd ..
npm install
cd ..
----------------------------------------
For user-2
cd user-2
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
npm install
----------------------------------------
